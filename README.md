## a bootstrap template built out with HTML, CSS, Javascript
I've made a few custom images in photoshop, added scroll animations with with material design for bootstrap, and rebuilt the contact section as well to remove the contact form.
I intend to build archive this site at some point in 2020, and move to new domain that will be more related to Data Science, since this original portfolio site was built around 2014-2015 to help bring in private clients for web design. The site is still hosted with GoDaddy and being serve via HTTP, and I don't think I'll buy an overpriced SSL certificate from them!
